Efficacy Across Political Regimes: The Authoritarian Advantage in Comparative Perspective
This paper critically examines the comparative effectiveness of counterterrorism strategies in authoritarian regimes vis-Ã -vis their democratic counterparts. It interrogates the mechanisms underlying authoritarian success in eliminating terrorism, specifically, the centralisation of power and decision-making, stringent control over information and populace, and willingness to employ repressive measures. Leveraging a rigorous research design, this study integrates in-depth case studies and empirical data analysis, supplemented by a comprehensive survey, to substantiate the argument that authoritarian regimes may have a comparative advantage in combating terrorism. However, the findings also spotlight the significant trade-offs between security and civil liberties, emphasising the nuanced understanding and acceptance of such trade-offs by the populace, as revealed by the survey. The paper underscores the importance of counterterrorism strategies that holistically consider both security and human rights concerns, advocating for a balanced approach that upholds societal security without eroding civil liberties. By exploring these intersections, this study contributes to the broader discourse on global counterterrorism efforts, emphasising the necessity for governments to foster trust and cooperation with their citizens, tackle the root causes of terrorism, and conduct transparent and inclusive policy debates for sustainable, ethical, and effective counterterrorism.
